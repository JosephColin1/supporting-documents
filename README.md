# supporting-documents
Supporting documents for the following paper - Catalytic conversion of alkenes on acidic zeolites: Automated generation of reaction mechanisms and lumping technique 

All documents should be downloaded for use. Each sub-folder contains the following files:
Components.0_R0
Reactions.txt

Most files contain the following file (ommitted from networks too large to generate visually via Cytoscape):
Network.cys

Components.0_R0 contains a list of all molecular species and intermediate carbenium ions in a network. 
Reactions.txt contans a list of all reactions occuring in the network including reactants, products, reaction enthaply, SMILE formula and reaction family.
Network.cys is a downloadable file which can be opened via the software Cytoscape (https://cytoscape.org/). This contains a visual reaction network.
